        <h3>Who is the Labrador Retriever?</h3>
        <p>The Labrador Retriever, commonly known as the Labrador, is a friendly and outgoing breed. Known for their intelligence and versatility, Labs are popular as family pets, as well as working dogs in roles such as assistance, search and rescue, and therapy.</p>
        
        <h3>Lifespan and Price in Sri Lanka</h3>

        <h3>Feeding Your Labrador Retriever</h3>
        <p>Labs need a balanced diet to stay healthy and active. Here are some key points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-Quality Dog Food: Opt for a dog food formulated for large breeds.</li>
            <li>Portion Control: Follow the feeding guidelines to prevent obesity, a common issue in Labs.</li>
            <li>Healthy Treats: Use treats for training, but give them sparingly.</li>
            <li>Fresh Water: Ensure they have access to fresh water at all times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consult your veterinarian for a feeding plan tailored to your Labrador Retriever's needs.</p>

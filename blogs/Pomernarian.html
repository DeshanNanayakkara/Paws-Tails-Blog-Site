  <h3>Who is Pomeranian ?</h3>
  <p>The Pomeranian, nicknamed the "Pom," is a small Spitz-type dog breed originating from Central Europe, specifically the Pomerania region of Poland and northwestern Germany.  Despite their small size, Poms are known for their regal appearance, lion-like mane, and abundant double coat.

    These lively companions come in a variety of vibrant colors, including orange, red, black, white, cream, and even brindle. Don't be fooled by their cuteness â€“ Poms are surprisingly alert and active, making them excellent watchdogs despite their diminutive stature.</p> 

    <h3>Lifespan and Price in Sri Lanka</h3>
    <p>The average lifespan of a healthy Pomeranian is between 12-15 years.  However, proper care and nutrition can significantly influence their longevity.When it comes to price, acquiring a Pomeranian puppy in Sri Lanka can vary depending on factors like pedigree, breeder reputation, and coat color.  Generally, you can expect prices to range from Rs. 80,000 to Rs. 200,0  00 or more  for a Pom puppy.  Remember, reputable breeders prioritize the health and well-being of their dogs, so be wary of prices that fall significantly outside this range</p>
        <h3>Feeding Your Pomeranian</h3>
        <p>Pomeranians have relatively small appetites, but they require a balanced diet to maintain their health and energy levels.  Here are some key points to consider:</p>

            <li>High-Quality Kibble: Opt for a high-quality kibble specifically formulated for small breed dogs.</li>

            <li>Treats in Moderation: Treats are great for training and rewards, but use them sparingly to avoid weight gain.</li>
            <li>Freshwater: Ensure your Pom has access to fresh, clean water at all times.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Consulting your veterinarian can help you develop a personalized feeding plan tailored to your Pom's specific needs and age.</p>
        <h3>The Pomeranian's Motherland: Pomerania</h3>

This area is known for its rolling hills, dense forests, and stunning coastline.While the exact origins of the breed remain unclear, some believe they descended from larger Spitz-type working dogs used for herding livestock and guarding property. Through selective breeding, Poms were developed into the smaller, companion-sized dogs we know and love today.Owning a Pomeranian is a rewarding experience, but it requires dedication and knowledge.  This guide provides a starting point, but further research on training, grooming, and common health concerns is essential to ensure your Pom thrives in your Sri Lankan home.</p>
